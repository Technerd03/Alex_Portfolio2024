        <center><p span class = "homebox2">The project to the left was one of the first I’ve done it was for web design and it was based on the History of the computer. When I first did this my knowledge for html and css was minimum but that didn’t stop me when it came to the creating a layout or color scheme. This project also sparked a passion for my work especially in html or java.<br/><br/>
        For the other image, this project students were tasked a making a program for a car rental company. I chose this to represent me because it was the first thing I ever fully coded. Since then I’ve improved significantly but I will always love the simple projects and the memories I obtain making them</p></center>
