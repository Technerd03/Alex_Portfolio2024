       <center><p span class = "homebox3">The Image on the Left was from when students were tasked with researching and creating an informative website on a species chosen by us. For my choice I chose the Gray Fox because foxes are my favorite animal and that it gave me a perfect opportunity to learn more about them. One highlight of this project was that I learned how to implement videos in my html files.<br/><br/>The image on the right represents one of the first times I worked with my group. For this project we were tasked with doing a few programs each and I chose to do the NL chocolate company program as one of them. My favorite part of this specfic project was it is where I started to notice the improvement in my speed with coding and creating these types of things.</p></center>
